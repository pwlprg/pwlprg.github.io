= Repos converting Hg -> Git
:hp-tags: hg, git, repo
[%hardbreaks]

Two methods which gave me best results:

1. In Windows, in-place, by hg-git extension
https://helgeklein.com/blog/2015/06/converting-mercurial-repositories-to-git-on-windows/

%Userprofile%\mercurial.ini
----
\[extensions\]
hggit = 
hgext.bookmarks =
\[git\]
intree = True
----

----
hg bookmark -r default master  (or)  hg bookmark master (for marking working tree as git's master)
hg gclear  (optionally, but for me was required)
hg gexport --debug
git config --bool core.bare false
git reset HEAD -- .
----

Problems: none
Result: ?

2. In Linux, side-by-side, by python tools fast-export
http://hivelogic.com/articles/converting-from-mercurial-to-git/

----
cd ~/dev/
git clone git://repo.or.cz/fast-export.git
git init git_repo
cd git_repo
~/dev/fast-export/hg-fast-export.sh -r /path/to/old/mercurial_repo
git checkout HEAD
----

Problems:
* unnamed heads
- can be resolved by '--force' switch for fast-export
- WON'T be converted to gi
* hidden changesets
- they are created if hg was using evolve extension (maybe when executing rebase?)
- fast-export don't support these
- they must be deleted from hg repo before conversion
- they can be restored after conversion (??)
